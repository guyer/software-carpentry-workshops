Document process for setting up a [Software Carpentry workshop](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops) at [NIST](http://www.nist.gov)

* Book a room

  http://nistrooms.nist.gov

  Things to consider:

  - conference rooms near the cafeteria are better for keeping breaks from 
    dragging on too long

  - least confusing if the workshop is in the same room for both days

  - novice/advanced tracks mean two rooms for two full days. Book early!
